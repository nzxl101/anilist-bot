# AniList.co Mass-Like/Follow User Bot
Disclaimer: Don't use this bot, if you want to keep the ability to like/follow/comment posts.  
This will get you 99.8% banned if you don't adjust the default settings.  

I'm only releasing this because I had enough fun coding and researching how to abuse GraphQL.  
If a moderator or admin of AniList sees this, please don't ban me entirely from the site.
